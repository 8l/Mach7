The current implementation of our library relies on static variables and global 
state, which will have problems in a multi-threaded environment. Efficient 
multi-threaded implementation is the first task on our list. 

We would also like to experiment with other kinds of cache indexing functions in 
order to decrease the frequency of conflicts, especially those coming from the use 
of dynamically-linked libraries.

The match statement that we presented here deals with only one scrutiny at the 
moment, but we believe that our memoization device, along with the v-table pointer memoization 
technique we presented, can cope reasonably efficiently with multiple scrutinies. 
Their support will make our library more general by addressing asymmetric 
multiple dispatch.
