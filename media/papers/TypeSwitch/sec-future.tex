In the future, we would like to provide a compiler implementation of our 
technique, which will enable a better surface syntax, improved diagnostics, 
increased performance and many other benefits hard to achieve in a library 
implementation.

%In the future we would like to provide an efficient multi-threaded 
%implementation of our library as currently it relies heavily on static variables 
%and global state, which will have problems in a multi-threaded environment. 
%
%Additionally, the match statement that we presented here deals with only one 
%subject at the moment, but we believe that the same technique can be used to 
%address multiple subjects.
%
%We would also like to experiment with other kinds of cache indexing functions in 
%order to decrease the frequency of conflicts, especially those coming from the use 
%of dynamically-linked libraries.
%
%Last but not least we would like to look at providing support for alternative 
%matching semantics.
