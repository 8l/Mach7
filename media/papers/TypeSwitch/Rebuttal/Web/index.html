<H1>Open and Efficient Type Switch for C++</H1>
Paper review supporting material.
<P>
The C++ pretty printer that we implemented using both type switching (open 
encoding) and visitor design pattern was ran on a set of standard header files 
to print them out. The produced output of both program was byte-to-byte the 
same.
</P>

<H2>Real Code Performance Comparison</H2>
<P>
The running times for the entire execution of the printer (not including loading 
and termination of the application or parsing of the input file) are presented 
below for two consequitive experiments. The numbers correspond to 2467841 units 
per 1 second. X indicates the winner. The general observation is that on small 
files (e.g. those from C run-time library and few small C++ files) visitors win 
because the total number of nodes in AST and thus calls does not justify our 
set-up calls. We win on all the large standard headers, where the total number 
of calls can reach numbers indicated below in the memory usage chart. The 
rightmost column lists lines of codes in each input file after preprocessing and 
removing any empty lines, #line directives and #pragmas.
</P>
<P>
Visitor-based implementation of pretty printer is faster on files of 44--588 
lines of code, with average 136 lines per those inputs, where visitors win. On 
these input files it is faster by 1.17%--21.42% with an average speed-up of 
8.75%. Open type switch based implementation of pretty printer is faster on 
files of 144--9851 lines of code, with average 3497 lines per those input files, 
where open type switch wins. On these inputs it is faster by 0.18% -- 32.99% 
with an average speed-up of 5.53%.

<H2>Synthetic Tests Performance Comparison</H2>
<P>
Synthetic tests were designed to compare the run-time performance of visitors 
and type switching in a setting where the actual pay-load functionality is the 
minimal (i.e. just returning a case number here), while the most of the time is 
spent on detecting the case. 
There are 24 test configurations, which are a combination of the following 4 
parameters described in details in the paper:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>3 use case scenarios: Repetitive, Random or Sequential
<LI>2 encodings: Open or Tag
<LI>2 syntax variations: Unified or Special
<LI>2 cases of presence or absence of forwarding to the base class in visitors.
</UL>

<P>
The result of the timing experiment can be seen in Excel Spreadsheet 
<a href="Timing.xlsx">Timing.xlsx</a>. Embedded version of the file can be seen 
below, however some features/information is not available when viewing in 
browser, so we suggest you download the file locally.
</P>
<P>
Please feel free to edit the four values that are allowed to be editable below 
to see the amount of cycles spent per iteration of a corresponding test by 
visitors and type switch. The first value can be in range 1-7 and controls the 
compiler configuration used for tests. The 3 other boolean parameters represent 
the 3 last parameters described above: Encoding, Syntax and Forwarding. 
The numbers hidden by the chart are copied from the corresponding sheet below by 
choosing compiler configuration. You can see it directly by clicking on the 
corresponding sheet.

<P>
All the tests have been performed in the diagnostic boot of Windows 7, in which 
the operating system loads only the bare minimum of drivers and services. This 
limits the effect of other applications on the timed application as well as 
makes the timing numbers very sustainable: i.e. you can see that each test of a 
given configuration was performed 3 times, with numbers representing the amount 
of cycles per iteration almost always beeing the same or different by 1.
</P>

<H2>Memory Usage</H2>
<P>
The picture below represents memory usage as well as cache hits and misses for 
the run of our pretty printer on 'queue' standard library header (it has the 
largest LOC after preprocessing in our test set).
</P>

<P align="center"><IMG src="Memory.png"></P>

<P>
There were 8 match statements in it marked A-H. The info [N/M] next to the 
letter indicates the actual number of different types (actually vtbl-pointers) 
that came through that match statement - N; and the amount of case clauses the 
match statement had - M (we use it as an estimate of types). N is also the 
number of cases the corresponding match statement had to be executed 
sequentially (instead of a direct jump).
</P>
<P>
Memory is measured in bytes. The blue part corresponds to our cache and the 
maroon - to the hash table that keeps mapping of elements to necessary info. 
Transparent parts of both colors indicate the allocated extra memory that is not 
holding any data.  The black box within the blue part also indicates the amount 
of entries in the cache that are allocated for only one vtbl pointer and thus 
never result in a cache miss. The non-transparent part without black box 
represents the percentage of vtbl pointers that have to share their cache entry 
with at least one other vtbl-pointer and thus may result in collisions during 
access.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of hits and misses for each of the match statements is 
indicated on top of the corresponding column. The sum of them is the total 
amount of calls made. Hits indicate situation when we found entry in cache and 
didn't have to make roundtrip to the hash-table to get it. Misses indicate the 
number of cases during actual run we had to pick the entry from the hash table 
and update the cache with it. The number of misses is always larger then or 
equal to N.
</P>
<P>
The last 3 match statements have memory pre-allocated for 8 types - that's the 
minimum size we preallocate, even when only one type will show up. Just an 
internal optimization. The rest of the entries allocate the amount of memory 
proportional to the larger of the two numbers M and N (actually the closest 
power of 2 after that maximum). The reason for that is also an internal 
optimization to avoid cache reconfigurations.
</P>
<P>
The table doesn't have to be hash table and can be implemented with any 
other container i.e. sorted vector, map etc. that let us find quickly by a given 
vtbl-ptr the data associated with it. If we implement it with sorted vector, the 
red part will shrink to only the non-transparent part.
</P>

<H2>Code Comparison</H2>

<P>The table below presents side-by-side comparison of the code implementing the 
C++ pretty-printer using visitors (left) and pattern-matching (right).</P>

<P>Both files were adopted from their original form in order to render as little 
differences as possible in order to let the reader see the exact correspondence 
in functionality. In particular the following changes were made:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The formal parameter of all the visit methods was renamed to 'matched' in 
order to correspond to the name of the variable with the same name we introduce 
in each case clause.
<LI>The variable-patterns of the Case-clauses were renamed to correspond to 
names of member-functions on the target object used to obtain their values. The 
visitor implementation calls those functions explicitly in corresponding places.
<LI>All the visitors were defined inside corresponding functions that invoke 
them with all the visit methods defined inline in order to match the structure 
of match statements as much as possible. This was not the case for visitors with 
large visit methods.
<LI>Any common code for both files was put into separate file to not obstruct 
comparison.
</UL> 

<P>The files were 798 lines (pattern matching) and 893 lines (visitors) before 
these changes were applied, making the pattern matching code about 11% shorter. 
Actually compared files are 719 lines long (pattern matching) and 732 lines long 
(visitors). Byte size of the pattern-matching source file is 34761 and visitors 
file 40464 bytes, making the pattern-matching source about 14% smaller.</P>
