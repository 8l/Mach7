Building sources

Just run make to build .exe files from all the .cpp files in directory.

Alternatively you can say make timings to build all combinations for performance evaluation

Known bugs and limitations

The following files crash GCC 4.4.5 on my Fedora 13 box. If they do on yours too, just delete them, they are all test cases anyways.
 - extractor.cpp
 - shape2.cpp
 - shape4.cpp
 - shape5.cpp
 - shape6.cpp
 - shape.cpp
 - numbers.cpp
 - category.cpp
 - exp.cpp
